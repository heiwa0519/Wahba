Implementations of the major developments in 3D-attitude determination of spacecraft.

##### Algorithms presented in the following papers are implemented:
1. Harold D. Black - A Passive System for Determining the Attitude of a Satellite (1964) [Tri-axial Attitude Determination (TRIAD method)]
2. Paul B. Davenport - A Vector Approach to the Algebra of Rotations with Applications (1968) [Davenport's q-method]
3. F. Landis Markley - Attitude Determination using Vector Observations and Singular Value Decomposition (1968) [SVD method]
4. Malcolm D. Shuster - Three-axis Attitude Determination from Vector Observations (1981) [Quaternion Estimator (QUEST)]
5. F. Landis Markley - Attitude Determination using Vector Observations, A Fast Optimal Matrix Algorithm (1993) [FOAM method]
6. Yaguang Yang and Zhiqiang Zhou - An Analytic Solution to Wahba's Problem (2013)
7. Yaguang Yang - Attitude Determination using Newton's Method on Riemannian Manifold (2015)
8. Jin Wu (et al.) - Fast Linear Quaternion Attitude Estimator Using Vector Observations (2017) [FLAE method]

***Note: Fundamentally all of the algorithms above except the TRIAD method are solutions to Wahba's problem.***
